# Exercise 2 – Thinking Like a Computer

## Description
Based on what you have learned, write a program that lists the instructions for a computer to locate the upstairs bathroom, as discussed in §2.1. Consider what steps a person would naturally assume, but a computer would not. Add them to your list to practice “thinking like a computer.”

For most people, “go to the bathroom” is a sufficient instruction. However, for someone unfamiliar with houses or bathrooms, the necessary steps could be extensive. Keep it within a page. You may include a short house layout description if needed.

## Situation
You are sleeping in your bedroom on the second floor.  
You wake up and want to go to the bathroom, but the bathroom is located on the first floor.

---

## Instructions
1. Get up from the bed, rotate 30 degrees to the right, and lower your feet to the floor.
2. Stand up and walk straight forward 50 centimeters toward the door.
3. Open the door by pulling the handle.
4. Rotate your body 30 degrees to the left.
5. Approach the staircase and lower your left foot to the first step below.
6. Move your right foot down to the same step.
7. Repeat this process until there are no more steps below your feet.
8. Rotate left and walk forward 50 centimeters, then rotate right and walk forward 1 meter.
9. Stop at the orange door. This is the bathroom.
10. You have arrived.

# Exercise 4 – Precise Instructions Using a Recipe

## Description
Read a recipe for blueberry muffins (or a more familiar dish, if preferred). Rewrite the recipe so every action is in its own numbered step. Include:
- All ingredients and utensils per step
- Oven temperature and preheating instructions
- Muffin pan preparation
- Cooking time and timing method
- Safety instructions for removing items from the oven

Consider the perspective of a complete beginner and fill in any omitted steps. Then create a glossary of terms and perform a practical test by baking the muffins.

## Current Status
This exercise is postponed due to time constraints. It will be completed later to ensure proper focus, including rewriting the recipe, glossary development, and real-world testing.

# Exercise 5 – Building Personal Definitions

## Description
Write definitions for each term listed in “Terms.” First attempt to define them from memory. Then, verify by checking the book or a reputable glossary. Store the definitions in a file for later updates as future chapters add more terminology.

---

## Note
This section is not completed here. Instead, I plan to build my own glossary in Notion.
