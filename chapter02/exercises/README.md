# Exercise 2 – Thinking Like a Computer

## Description
Expanding on what you have learned, write a program that lists the instructions for a computer to find the upstairs
bathroom, discussed in §2.1. Can you think of any more steps that a person would assume, but that a computer would not?
Add them to your list. This is a good start in “thinking like a computer.” Warning: For most people, “go to the bathroom”
is a perfectly adequate instruction. For someone with no experience with houses or bathrooms (imagine a stone-age
person, somehow transported into your dining room) the list of necessary instructions could be very long. Please don’t
use more than a page. For the benefit of the reader, you may add a short description of the layout of the house you are
imagining.

## Situation

The situation is as follows: you are sleeping in your bedroom on the second floor.  
You wake up and want to go to the bathroom, but unfortunately the bathroom is on the first floor.

## Instructions

1. Get up from the bed, rotate your body 30 degrees to the right, then lower your feet from the bed onto the floor.
2. Stand up from the bed and walk straight forward for 50 centimeters toward the door.
3. Open the door by pulling the handle.
4. Rotate your body 30 degrees to the left.
5. There is a staircase. Lower your left foot first onto the first lower step below your current position.
6. Move your right foot down to the same step.
7. Repeat this process until there is no lower step than the one your feet are currently on.
8. Rotate your body to the left and walk forward for 50 centimeters, then rotate to the right and walk forward for 1 meter.
9. There is an orange-colored door. You have reached the bathroom.
10. Finished.


# Exercise 3 – Giving Precise Instructions

## Description

Write a description of how to get from the front door of your dorm room, apartment, house, whatever, to the door of your
classroom (assuming you are attending some school; if you are not, pick another target). Have a friend try to follow the
instructions and annotate them with improvements as he or she goes along. To keep friends, it may be a good idea to
“field test” those instructions before giving them to a friend.

## Situation

The starting point is the front gate of my house.

## Instructions

1. Walk forward for 50 centimeters from your current standing position.
2. Rotate your body 30 degrees to the right.
3. Walk straight forward for 300 meters.
4. Rotate your body 30 degrees to the right.
5. Walk straight forward for 900 meters.
6. Rotate your body 30 degrees to the left.
7. Stop. You have arrived in front of the school gate.

# Exercise 4 – Precise Instructions Using a Recipe

## Description

Find a good cookbook. Read the instructions for baking blueberry muffins (if you are in a country where “blueberry
muffins” is a strange, exotic dish, use a more familiar dish instead). Please note that with a bit of help and instruction,
most of the people in the world can bake delicious blueberry muffins. It is not considered advanced or difficult fine
cooking. However, for the author, few exercises in this book are as difficult as this one. It is amazing what you can do
with a bit of practice.
• Rewrite those instructions so that each individual action is in its own numbered paragraph. Be careful to list all
ingredients and all kitchen utensils used at each step. Be careful about crucial details, such as the desired oven
temperature, preheating the oven, the preparation of the muffin pan, the way to time the cooking, and the need to protect
your hands when removing the muffins from the oven.
• Consider those instructions from the point of view of a cooking novice (if you are not one, get help from a friend who
does not know how to cook). Fill in the steps that the book’s author (almost certainly an experienced cook) left out for
being obvious.
• Build a glossary of terms used. (What’s a muffin pan? What does preheating do? What do you mean by “oven”?)
• Now bake some muffins and enjoy your results.

## Current Status

This exercise is intentionally postponed.

Due to time constraints, the full implementation of this exercise has been deferred and will be completed at a later time when sufficient time is available to carry it out properly, including rewriting the recipe, building a glossary of terms, and performing a real-world test.

## Notes

This exercise is recognized as time-intensive and is deferred to ensure it can be completed with proper focus and attention rather than rushed execution. The intent is to preserve the learning value of the exercise rather than completing it superficially.

# Exercise 5 – Building Personal Definitions

## Description

Write a definition for each of the terms from “Terms.” First try to see if you can do it without looking at the chapter (not
likely), then look through the chapter to find definitions. You might find the difference between your first attempt and the
book’s version interesting. You might consult some suitable online glossary, such as www.stroustrup.com/glossary.html.
By writing your own definition before looking it up, you reinforce the learning you achieved through your reading. If you
have to reread a section to form a definition, that just helps you to understand. Feel free to use your own words for the
definitions, and make the definitions as detailed as you think reasonable. Often, an example after the main definition will
be helpful. You may like to store the definitions in a file so that you can add to them from the “Terms” sections of later
chapters.

---

## Format of Definitions

Each term is documented using the following structure:

- **Term name**
- **My definition** (written before checking the book)
- **Refined definition** (after comparison with the book)

1. //
	- comment
	- is block code that got comment will not execute by compiler, it used to documented our code.
	- Anything written after the token // (that’s the character /, called “slash,” twice) on a line is a comment.
	  Comments are ignored by the compiler and written for the benefit of programmers who read the code. Here, we used the
	  comment to tell you what the beginning of that line actually did.
2. <<
	- output operator
	- ?
	- ?
3. C++
	- C++ Programming Language
	- C++ is low level programming language, it gave developer more control over hardware
	- ?
4. Compiler
	- is a tool used to translate c++ code/human readble code to machine code
	- C++ is a compiled language. That means that to get a program to run, you must first translate it from the human-readable form to
      something a machine can “understand.” That translation is done by a program called a compiler.
5. Compile time-error
	- Error got when we compile our program
	- Errors found by the compiler are called compile-time errors
6. cout
	- cout stand for console output
	- is an abbreviation of “character output stream.”
7. Executable
	- a program can be execute(run) by computer
	- a program ready to be run (executed) on a computer.
